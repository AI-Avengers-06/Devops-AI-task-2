title: AI-Native KRA -- DevOps Assignment 2 (CI/CD Pipeline Health
  Dashboard)
---

**You Tube Course** - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnC6cF1v5OY>

Build a **CI/CD Pipeline Health Dashboard** to monitor executions from
tools like **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins**.

The dashboard should:

- Collect data on pipeline executions (success/failure, build time,
  status).

- Show real-time metrics:

  - ✅ Success/Failure rate

  - 🕒 Average build time

  - 📌 Last build status

- Send alerts (via **Slack** or **Email**) on pipeline failures.

- Provide a **simple frontend UI** to:

  - Visualize pipeline metrics

  - Display logs/status of latest builds

This should simulate how modern engineering teams monitor the health of
their CI/CD systems using automation, observability, and actionable
alerting.

## **✅ Expected Outcome** {#expected-outcome}

The candidate is expected to use **GitHub Copilot** or **Cursor IDE** +
GPT-4 for ideation, design, and development assistance.

## **📦 Deliverables** {#deliverables}

- Public links or text logs of prompts used with **Copilot**,
  **Cursor**, or **ChatGPT**.

### **2. 🧠 Requirement Analysis Document** {#requirement-analysis-document}

- Use GPT/CoPilot/Cursor to analyze/expand the requirement.

- Present understanding in terms of:

  - Key features

  - Tech choices

  - APIs/tools required

### **3. 🏗️ Tech Design Document** {#tech-design-document}
